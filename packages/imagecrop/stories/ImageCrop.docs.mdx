<Subtitle>Dialog component to crop an uploaded image to a target width/height</Subtitle>

## Description

The `image-crop-dialog` web component opens a dialog that lets users select and crop an image
to a specific target size. It is designed to be embedded in forms: once the user confirms the crop,
the resulting image file is placed in the form data under the same `name` as the file input.

This documentation page is powered by the same stories and args used in the controls panel,
so what you see here always reflects the live story configuration.

Tag name: `image-crop-dialog`

## Usage

<Source
  language="html"
  code={`<form>
  <image-crop-dialog width="600" height="800">
    <input type="file" accept="image/png, image/jpeg, image/tiff" name="picture" />
    <span slot="label-cancel">Abbrechen</span>
    <span slot="label-confirm">Bestätigen</span>
  </image-crop-dialog>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>`}
/>

## Interactive example

## Properties / Attributes

<ArgTypes of={ImageCropStories.Default} />

## Notes

- Place an `<input type="file" name="...">` inside the component; it will be used as the source image.
- Provide optional slot content for `label-cancel` and `label-confirm` to localize the dialog actions.
- On submit, the cropped image will be available from the form data for the file input's `name`.
